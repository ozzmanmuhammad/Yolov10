# YOLOv10 Notebook

This repository contains a modified version of the Roboflow YOLOv9 notebook. The modifications include updates for YOLOv10 and the addition of inference and supervision functionalities using the respective libraries.


## Overview

This notebook was created using the Roboflow YOLOv9 notebook as a base and has been enhanced to support YOLOv10. This repo will contain all the upcoming experiments and modifications for the players detection, match analysis and much more 

## Features
- **YOLOv10 Support**: Enhanced the notebook to support the latest YOLOv10 model for improved performance.
- **Inference Library**: Integrated inference library for running and testing models.
- **Supervision Library**: Added supervision library for better model management and tracking.
